This is a inference code for object detection. 
Object detection is a computer vision technique in which a software system can detect, locate, and trace the object from a given image or video. The special attribute about object detection is that it identifies the class of object (person, table, chair, etc.) and their location-specific coordinates in the given image. The location is pointed out by drawing a bounding box around the object. The bounding box may or may not accurately locate the position of the object. The ability to locate the object inside an image defines the performance of the algorithm used for detection. Face detection is one of the examples of object detection.

These object detection algorithms might be pre-trained or can be trained from scratch. In most use cases, we use pre-trained weights from pre-trained models and then fine-tune them as per our requirements and different use cases.
In our project we will be using TensorFlow model for the purpose with model RCNN_resnet_v2_1.
